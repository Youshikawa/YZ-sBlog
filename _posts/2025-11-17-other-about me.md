Hi, I’m a master’s graduate from ZUST.
I enjoy programming contests, multi-modal language models, and Kaggle-style data science competitions.
On this site, I’ll be writing about algorithms and optimization, advanced AI, and occasionally my everyday life.
My codeforcesID: Tsukuba(max rate 1936)
You can follow me on Github!
